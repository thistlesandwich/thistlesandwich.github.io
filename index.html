				<h1>WELCOME!</h1>
				<p>We are an energetic female-fronted rock band in the UK: three girls upfront with Helen on guitar, Nicole on bass, Geri on vocals... and Guy on drums! We bring you upbeat classic rock covers you love from across the decades, that maybe you haven’t heard for a while, as well as adding other genres in our own style to mix things up and keep you dancing. We are based in Hertfordshire and north Kent, so mainly cover London and surrounding counties, but are happy to travel anywhere to rock out and party!</p>
    			<p>Check out our social media and links for contact details, bookings and finding out what we're up to.</p>
    			<p>We are excited to see you soon!</p>

				<h1>MEET THE BOOBIES!</h1>
				<h2>Helen</h2>
				<div id="bio-photo"><img src="images/helen.jpeg" height="75%" width="75%"></div>
				<p><span class="bio-text">Helen began life as a classical pianist, then one day decided to buy a guitar and learn some AC/DC. It proceeded to get way out of hand in a way she never expected, but she's never looked back. Meeting the Boobies, in a moment of "why not!", she fulfilled her love of playing music with others and discovered a passion for performing live. With a love for classic rock, you can't miss her solid rhythm riffs and extended guitar solos; she is energetic on stage and likes to compete with Guy for loudest Booby!</span></p>
			    <h2>Nic</h2>
				<div id="bio-photo"><img src="images/nic.jpeg" height="75%" width="75%"></div>					
				<p><span class="bio-text">Nicole might have picked up the bass later than most, but she’s carved out a sound that’s become a core part of the band’s identity. Joining Booby Trap pushed her to grow fast and she’s embraced every moment of it. With eclectic musical influences and a feel for locking in with the groove, she brings a steady, expressive low end that lets the rest of the band shine. On stage, she’s rarely still... dancing, moving, and syncing up with Helen to help give every live show its spark!</span></p>
				<h2>Geri</h2>
				<div id="bio-photo"><img src="images/geri.jpg" height="75%" width="75%"></div>
				<p><span class="bio-text">Joining Booby Trap in the summer of 2025, Geri steps in as the band’s powerhouse vocalist, bringing a lifetime of performance experience and an undeniable passion for the stage. A graduate of Sydney’s prestigious Newtown High School of the Performing Arts, she is a true triple threat across music, dance, and drama, classically trained from a young age. Signed to Sony Music Australia at just 18 as part of girl band Cherry, Geri gained national media exposure and has toured throughout Australia and the Far East as both a soloist and ensemble performer, appearing at major entertainment, sporting, and theatre venues. With a vocal background spanning classical, pop, country, and jazz big band, embracing rock has become her most exciting challenge yet.</span></p>
				<h2>Guy</h2>
				<div id="bio-photo"><img src="images/guy.jpg" height="75%" width="75%"></div>						
				<p><span class="bio-text">Guy came to the Boobies with over 400 gigs, several albums, and too many years of experience behind him.  He stepped in to help out for few gigs in 2023 and was soon begging the girls to let him stay. Ever since then, his happy place is behind the kit for Booby Trap, driving their energetic rock grooves onwards, with his heavy right foot, an undying love for the floor tom, and backing vocals that hide his secret ambition to be a singer when he grows up!</span></p>
